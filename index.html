        <h1>Ashak Recipe</h1>
        <hr>
        <p><b>History:</b></p>
        <p>Ashak is a traditional Afghan dish. It is usually eaten during special events such as parties or weddings because it is expensive and also time consuming to make. Afghan cuisines have elements from different places such as mint from Iran, dumplings and noodles from Uzbekistan. They are filled with <i>gandana</i> which is a type of leek grown in Afghanistan. It is usually served with heated oil poured all over the platter, chaka which is a thicker yogurt, ghooroshte lape or otherwise, lentils, cilantro and crushed dry mint to top everything off. Another food that is similar to ashak is mantu, however, instead of being stuffed with just greens, it is stuffed with meat.</p>
        <p>This recipe is the recipe my mom has used for years to make ashak for me and my brother. She has perfected it over the years, measurements for the ingredients will be for the serving of two people; multiply, if necessary. </p>
